The subdivision of this species into two varieties, watermelons (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) var. lanatus) and citron melons (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides (L. H. Bailey) Mansf.), originated with the erroneous synonymization of Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai and Citrullus vulgaris Schrad. by L.H. Bailey in 1930.

				Cherry pie is associated with Europe, North America and is mentioned in the lyrics of American folk songs such as Billy Boy. Due to the cherry harvest in midsummer coinciding with Canada Day on July 1 and America's Independence Day on July 4, cherry pie is often served on these holidays. It is also associated with the celebration of Washington's Birthday because of the legend of young Washington’s honesty regarding the felling of a cherry tree.

			<div id="salami">
				<img src="images/salami.png">
				Salami (singular salame) is a type of cured sausage consisting of fermented and air-dried meat, typically beef or pork. Historically, salami was popular among southern and central European peasants because it stores at room temperature for up to 40 days once cut, supplementing a potentially meager or inconsistent supply of fresh meat. Countries and regions across Europe make their own traditional varieties of salami.

			<div id="sausage">
				<img src="images/sausage.png">
				A sausage is a cylindrical meat product usually made from ground meat, often pork, beef, or veal, along with salt, spices and other flavourings, and breadcrumbs, encased by a skin. Typically, a sausage is formed in a casing traditionally made from intestine, but sometimes from synthetic materials. Sausages that are sold raw are cooked in many ways, including pan-frying, broiling and barbecuing. Some sausages are cooked during processing and the casing may then be removed.
			</div>

			<div id="swiss-cheese">
				<img src="images/swiss-cheese.png">
				Swiss cheese is a generic name in North America for several related varieties of cheese, mainly of North American manufacture, which resemble Emmental cheese, a yellow, medium-hard cheese that originated in the area around Emmental, in Switzerland. Some types of Swiss cheese have a distinctive appearance, as the blocks of the cheese are riddled with holes known as "eyes". Swiss cheese without eyes is known as "blind". (The term is applied to cheeses of this style made outside Switzerland, such as Jarlsberg cheese, which originates in Norway).
